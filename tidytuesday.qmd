[#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/) is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. This project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook. Emphasis is placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome.

While I regularly participate in weekly Tidy Tuesday, these posts highlight my favorite submissions and the corresponding code.
