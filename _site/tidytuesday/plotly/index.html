<span class="header-section-number">3</span> Impute and clean the data for Washington</h2>
<p>After filtering data for Washington, I use the tidyr fill function to impute missing data within each subsector with the next complete value. While there are many ways of imputing the data, I chose this method to indicate that change is more likely to be tending towards the next available value of change.</p>
<p>You may choose not to impute the data as well or use other methods like average.</p>
