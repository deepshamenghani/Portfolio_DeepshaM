## Deepsha Menghani

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
I have been a Data Scientist at Microsoft for 3 years. I have an extensive background working with varied data sets and using advanced analytics to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in cross-language R/Python environment using reticulate, and data visualizations using animation and interactivity. I love learning new things constantly and sharing my knowledge with others in a digestible manner.   

I am very passionate about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and lead actionable initiatives and conversations to drive inclusiveness within our organization.

This dashboard, built with Shiny Flex capability, looks at data from EverythingYouWillNeed.com website (___fake data___) to report out odaily product sales. You can select the product, the dates to analyze and click on apply to replicate the report, check sales forecast and anomalies for the specific product choice.

This Shiny dashboard was built specifically for that purpose.... [Link to play with the Shiny dashboard](https://hzon6a-deepsha-menghani.shinyapps.io/Sales_forecast_anomalies/)

::: columns

::: {.column width="55%"}
No actions were taken from the insights you produced, and there was no impact on the business. Your beautiful analysis went on to sit in a folder unseen by anybody ever again. Let's name this folder "the analysis morgue." It contains more moribund analyses than it ought to because this scenario represents a common problem with data analytics teams, and by experiencing it you are not alone.

But there are ways to avoid it.... [Continue reading](https://medium.com/p/5d62c929a36c)
