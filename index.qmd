I am a Sr. Data Scientist at Microsoft. I have extensive background working with varied data sets and using advanced analytics to enable business stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in cross-language R/Python environment using Reticulate, and data visualizations using animation and interactivity. I am passionate about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and lead actionable initiatives and conversations to drive inclusiveness within our organization.
